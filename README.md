## üìä Sample Output

### Generated Cover Letter
```
Dear Hiring Manager,

As an Infrastructure Engineer with 3+ years maintaining 99.8% uptime, 
I'm excited to apply for the Senior DevOps Engineer position at TechCorp.

My background uniquely positions me for this role:

‚Ä¢ Infrastructure Foundation: Linux/Windows server management with focus 
  on reliability and monitoring
‚Ä¢ Automation Growth: Python development including GitHub API integration 
  and content generation systems  
‚Ä¢ Current Learning: Building Memory Platform - AI-powered family connection 
  app with data analysis components

The Memory Platform requires solid infrastructure to handle family data 
securely - same foundation thinking I'd bring to your infrastructure challenges.

Recent accomplishments that demonstrate my Infrastructure ‚Üí AI transition:
‚Ä¢ GitHub Development Logger Bot (Python, APIs, content automation)
‚Ä¢ Memory Platform development (AI, data processing, user experience)  
‚Ä¢ Infrastructure monitoring with 99.8% uptime achievement

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my infrastructure expertise 
and growing automation skills can contribute to TechCorp's success.

Best regards,
Trey Ellingson
