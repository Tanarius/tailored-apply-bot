# TailoredApply Bot ðŸŽ¯

**Job Application Content Generator for Infrastructure â†’ AI Career Transition**

*Built by Trey - Infrastructure Engineer transitioning to AI/Automation Specialist*

## What It Does

Transforms job posting URLs into personalized application content in seconds. No more staring at blank cover letter templates!

**Input:** Job posting URL  
**Output:** Customized cover letter + talking points + job fit analysis

## Triple-Duty Strategy

Like all my projects, this bot serves three purposes:

1. **Personal Use:** Actually helps me apply to jobs faster with quality content
2. **Portfolio Showcase:** Demonstrates web scraping, AI integration, and automation skills  
3. **Memory Platform Marketing:** Naturally explains my AI-powered family connection app in context

## Key Features

- âœ… **Multi-Platform Scraping** - Works with Indeed, LinkedIn, SEEK, and more
- âœ… **Smart Job Analysis** - Identifies skill matches and fit scores
- âœ… **Template Selection** - Chooses best approach based on job requirements
- âœ… **Memory Platform Integration** - Contextual mentions of my AI project
- âœ… **Professional Output** - Generates both text files and analysis data

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements_tailored_apply.txt

# Generate application content
python tailored-apply-bot.py --url "https://jobsite.com/job/12345"
```

## Example Output

**Input:** Infrastructure Engineer job posting  
**Output:** Personalized cover letter highlighting:
- 99.8% uptime track record (infrastructure credibility)
- GitHub automation bot development (AI transition proof)
- Memory Platform project (innovation and learning mindset)

## Technical Architecture

**Web Scraping:** BeautifulSoup with multiple site-specific selectors  
**Content Analysis:** Keyword matching and skill categorization  
**Template Engine:** Dynamic content generation with variable substitution  
**Output Management:** JSON analysis + formatted text files

## Career Transition Strategy

This bot embodies my "Infrastructure â†’ AI" transition approach:

- **Leverage existing strengths** (reliability, systems thinking)
- **Demonstrate new skills** (automation, content generation, AI integration)  
- **Tell consistent story** (growth mindset, practical applications)

Just like the Memory Platform turns family stories into meaningful connections, this bot turns job postings into personalized career opportunities.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic usage
python tailored-apply-bot.py --url "https://company.com/careers/infrastructure-engineer"

# Custom output directory  
python tailored-apply-bot.py --url "job_url" --output-dir "./applications/"
```

## Files Generated

Each run creates:
- `application_CompanyName_TIMESTAMP_cover_letter.txt` - Ready-to-use cover letter
- `application_CompanyName_TIMESTAMP_analysis.json` - Full job analysis and data

## Why This Approach Works

**For Employers:** Shows I build tools to solve real problems (exactly what they need)  
**For Job Search:** Actually speeds up my application process with quality content  
**For Portfolio:** Demonstrates practical AI/automation skills with immediate value
